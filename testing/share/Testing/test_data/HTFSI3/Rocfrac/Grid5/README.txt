REMARKS: There is a also a HEX mesh (generated by pointwise) in
         this folder. It is not used for the problem and only
         left for future reference. Rocfrac does not provide a
         full support for HEX elements. There is a boundary con-
         dition file in the folder als well that can be used for 
         generating patran neutral file from the pointwise output 
         file with gridConversion utility (see the utility docu-
         ment for more information).
