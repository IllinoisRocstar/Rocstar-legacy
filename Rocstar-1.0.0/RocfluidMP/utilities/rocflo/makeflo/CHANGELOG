Version 1.94 9/16/2004 by olawlor
Minor update to ckhashtable.h for gcc 3.4.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.93 8/14/2004 by olawlor
Tightened mesh quality criterion, to be *stricter*, not looser,
than Rocflo's quality criterion.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.92 7/6/2004 by olawlor
Added a warning when fabricating an external boundary condition.
Missing external boundary conditions often indicate a 
slightly non-conformal or non-matching block-block interface.

Also added printouts for mesh quality, with a warning if 
Rocflo's mesh quality bounds are violated.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.91 2/18/2004 by olawlor
Added gridgen binary mesh formats .grds and .grdd.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.9 12/16/2002 by olawlor
Changed RocfloMP boundary condition definition file extension
to ".bcmp".  This allows Rocflo and RocfloMP boundary condition
files to coexist, because now they have different extensions.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.891 10/11/2002 by olawlor

Fixed output filename in write.cpp.  This caused HDF output
files to overwrite one another.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.89 7/31/2002 by olawlor

New CkHashtable from Charm++ archive-- fixes bus error
on Origin2000.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.88 7/11/2002 by olawlor

Integrated Jiri's new .grda mesh format routines, which store
the RocfloMP mesh all in one big file.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.87 5/7/2002 by olawlor

Changed definition of type 2 boundary conditions yet again--
now one of *every* pair of faces *will* be made type 2, not
just those that are on the boundary or smaller.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.86 4/29/2002 by olawlor

Added -2D and -top options to makemblock (need some easy way to 
add these to makeflo, too).  These decrease the memory usage
when solving a 2D problem/solving a topology-only problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.84 03/21/2002 by olawlor

Now properly handle .inp files that contain block names with 
spaces.  Previously this would derail the input routines--
fscanf(in,"%s",str) is a silent killer!

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.83 03/20/2002 by olawlor
	-Now automatically determine the quantization to use. 
A very fine quantization results in a large scale factor. With
a large mesh this causes the integer coordinates in a "hashableVector3d" 
to saturate to 0xffffffff, because floating-point to integer conversions
do *NOT* wrap around (unlike, say, integer-to-char conversions).
Since all nodes hash to 0xfffffff, every node in the mesh is adjacent.

Using a coarse quantization avoids this problem, but might mistakenly 
lump together distinct nodes.  A reasonable point in the trade-off
is now reached automatically (see the "Encountered large node coordinates:
quantizing to xxx" status messages).


	-Floating point to integer quantization is now shifted to
only map to positive integers (see the "originMapsTo" global in 
"adj.cpp").  This is needed because CkHashtable (stupidly) silently
uses a special negative value (-17) of the first integer of the
hashtable key to indicate "empty key".  Without this origin shift,
nodes which happened to have a quantized X grid value of -17 were
ignored by the hashtable, since their key was indistinguishable from
the empty key.


	-Fixed a bug in the patching algorithm.  If two faces
build their patches using different search directions, they can
arrive at different patchings for the same interface (see figure).
Since faces' search directions are determined by their blocks' 
coordinate systems, different blocks could thus disagree about the
layout of their common interface.

Figure showing different patchings for same face.
XXXX is a pre-existing exterior patch.  Left figure
shows patches found by a horizontal-first search;
right figure shows a vertical-first search.

This bug has been eliminated by adding common patches to
*both* faces the first time the patch is found (see face::buildPatches).
Thus whichever block does its search first will determine the
patches that constitute the interface, and hence no disagreement
is possible.  This has the added benefit of being slightly more 
efficient.
