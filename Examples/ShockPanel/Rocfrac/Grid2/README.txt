NOTES: This is a fine 10-node tet model of the 1mm thick X 50mm long panel. It was meshed with a global edge length = 0.0003 for a total of 138386 tets. Boundary conditions are:

  -fixed in XYZ at the bottom
  -fixed in Z on the non-interacting side edges, but free to move in XY plane
  -front, back and top are interacting nonburning
